# Graphy Road

Graphy Road is a traffic simulator game. Users can build road connections of different types — one-way, two-way, highway — between commercial and residential buildings, to adjust traffic flow. Road construction of various types costs varying amounts of money, and the user attempts to stay within budget while optimizing their road layout.
